# Description

Let's call a sorted array of numbers (or elements from a set that have partial order relationship defined) a data block. Two data blocks are said to be non-overlapping if the ranges defined by the numbers in the data blocks are disjoint. Sorted data blocks constitute a partition. Given several partitions, find a way to sort all the numbers appeared. You are encouraged to optimize your solution as to your best extent.

# Possible solution

## Bruteforce

Just concatenate all data blocks into a large array, then use any sorting algorithm to sort it.

## Heap based merge sort

## Tournament tree based merge sort

# Benchmark

# Parallelism optimization
